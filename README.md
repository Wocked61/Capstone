# Capstone
This is the repository for the Capstone project for CSUF CPSC 490/491. This project aims to develop a time management app that helps users with daily planning, health management, like eating and drinking, and logistical issues, such as shopping/errands. The system will provide notifications and reminders for tasks like assignments, appointments, exercise, goals, meals, hydration, and sleep. The goal is to help users gain a balance in life with productivity and wellness by creating a schedule for the user for optimal living conditions. This project would start as a full-stack web application for accessibility, utilizing APIs like Google Maps for traffic information and an AI model of choice to manage efficient time management. The tracking of the statistics of the Userâ€™s lifestyle would help the User with visualizing the data of their health. Later on, if there is time in the development cycle, then the development would move to mobile applications, but the scope of the project is currently on the full-stack application for display.

# Introduction & Statement of Need
Many people struggle with balancing academics, work, and personal responsibilities. Missed deadlines, time management, and unhealthy living are results of ineffective planning. The project aims to help people with an assistant that can do the planning optimally that track tasks, life responsibilities, and work on behalf of the user to make their lives easier. The assistant would ask the user for their daily activities, Height, Weight, and needs, like if they have to go to the bank, and the assistant would make an optimal schedule considering traffic, time availability, and bodily functions. AI assistants like Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa are useful to people but are simple in their function, as they do not effectively plan for the user, but set a reminder for them.
