# Capstone
This is the repository for the Capstone project for CSUF CPSC 490/491. This project aims to develop a time management app that helps users with daily planning, health management, like eating and drinking, and logistical issues, such as shopping/errands. The system will provide notifications and reminders for tasks like assignments, appointments, exercise, goals, meals, hydration, and sleep. The goal is to help users gain a balance in life with productivity and wellness by creating a schedule for the user for optimal living conditions. This project would start as a full-stack web application for accessibility, utilizing APIs like Google Maps for traffic information and an AI model of choice to manage efficient time management. The tracking of the statistics of the Userâ€™s lifestyle would help the User with visualizing the data of their health. Later on, if there is time in the development cycle, then the development would move to mobile applications, but the scope of the project is currently on the full-stack application for display.
